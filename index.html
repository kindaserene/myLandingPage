            <ul class="card">your brain gets a break you know how steve jobs wore the same black shirt every day? same concept but for food. one less thing to think about, more mental space for stuff that actually matters.</ul>
            <ul class="card">you get back your time no more standing in front of the fridge for 10 minutes. no more scrolling through delivery apps. no more grocery store wandering. you know exactly what you're eating and can just get on with your day.</ul>
            <ul class="card">checkout all the macros when you eat the same thing daily, you can dial in exactly the right amount of protein, carbs, fats, everything. no guessing if you're eating enough or too much of something.</ul>
            <ul class="card">it's weirdly liberating sounds boring, but it's actually freeing. like having a uniform for your stomach. you stop thinking about it and just... eat the thing that makes you feel good.</ul>
