**optimize nutrition, minimize decisions**

## What is this?

An app that helps you decide EXACTLY what to eat so you never have to think about meals again. Set up takes 5 minutes, saves you hours of daily decision-making forever.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

The frontend is live but the backend is currently being built. You can explore the interface (aka just by reading this page lol), but full functionality isn't available yet.

## Why "lamify" your diet?

- **Free up cognitive bandwidth** - Stop wasting mental energy on "what should I eat today?"
- **Save time and money** - No more fridge staring or delivery app scrolling sessions
- **Dial in your macros** - Hit your protein, carbs, and fats perfectly with consistent eating
- **Find freedom in simplicity** - Less variety, more clarity about what makes you feel good

## The Problem We're Solving

Most people waste ~2 hours daily thinking about food decisions. This app eliminates that entirely by helping you find your perfect repeatable meal plan.

## Coming Soon

- Personalized meal recommendations
- Macro tracking and optimization
- Shopping list generation
- Meal prep planning
- Progress tracking

## Built by

Serene - someone who got tired of decision fatigue around food.
